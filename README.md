# Road-Segmentation_U-Net

## Overview
This repository explores the applicability of the U-Net model for **Road Segmentation**, a critical task in self-driving cars and urban planning. U-Net, originally designed for medical image segmentation, was adapted and enhanced to segment road regions from images, leveraging its precise image segmentation capabilities.

## Key Highlights
- **Research Objective**: Evaluate U-Net's effectiveness in road segmentation and improve its performance through structural enhancements.
- **Dataset**: The **KITTI dataset** was utilized, focusing on road segmentation tasks. Data augmentation techniques, including rotation, scaling, and brightness adjustment, were applied for better generalization.
- **Model Enhancements**:
  - Increased depth in the upsampling stage for better feature learning.
  - Incorporated **multi-scale convolution** to handle complex patterns effectively.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: 0.9878
  - **Validation Accuracy**: 0.8944
  - **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: 0.8532

## Implementation Details
1. **U-Net Architecture**: 
   - Symmetrical "U" shape with contracting and expanding paths.
   - **Skip connections** for detailed feature recovery.
   - Modified upsampling layers to better learn intricate road patterns.
